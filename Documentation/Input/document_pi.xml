    <Title>Understanding XML Processing Instructions</Title>
    <Body>
      Processing instructions (PIs) are a special type of XML node that contain instructions
      for applications processing the XML document. They are not part of the document's
      character data but provide information to software reading the document.
      
      Common uses include:
      - Stylesheet references (xml-stylesheet)
      - Schema associations (xml-model)
      - Editor-specific instructions (like the oxygen PI above)
      - Application-specific directives
      
      Processing instructions have the form: &lt;?target instructions?&gt;
      Where "target" identifies the application to which the instruction is directed,
      and "instructions" contains the actual instructions.
